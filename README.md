## Hola Welt 👋 🌍

I'm Monserrat, a Mexican data analyst who believes technology should serve everyone, not just a few. Over the past six years, I've worked at the intersection of data, policy, and social impact.

👩🏽‍💻 I recently completed my **Master's in Data Science for Public Policy** at the Hertie School in Berlin, where I specialized in Digital Governance. My thesis was on estimating the energy consumption and environmental impact of data centers in Europe (you can find more [here](https://github.com/Monlo/thesis-dc-emissions)). During my studies, I worked as a research assistant in the Digital Economy and Internet Policy group at the Weizenbaum Institute. 

I'm currently working as a data and policy consultant, developing data-driven research reports and analyses. I'm also seeking full-time opportunities at the intersection of data, policy, and decision-making.

🌱 I co-founded **[Hijas de Internet](https://hijasdeinternet.org/)** (Daughters of the Internet), where we advocate for digital spaces that are safer, more diverse, and inclusive for everyone—especially in Mexico and the Global South.
